Eager to expand my knowledge and make a meaningful impact. I'm thrilled to be apart of Penn State University's esteemed Ecology Master's program, where I am actively pursuing knowledge-sharing opportunities to benefit the global community.
### About Me
#### Hello
Welcome to my website, where I aim to offer you a glimpse into my life and the incredible experiences I've had. Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of information about me, covering almost everything you need to know.

#### My Story
Coming from Kansas City, KS, I have embraced the urban lifestyle throughout my upbringing. However, my childhood was a bit different from most kids. Toys and imagination didn't captivate me; instead, I found solace in exploration. Days were spent observing the intriguing world of insects in my yard, marveling at their interactions and movements. Watching birds frolic in the birdbath and squirrels darting through the yard became my enchanting pastime, mesmerizing me for hours.

​

As I grew older, societal norms steered me away from these exploratory endeavors. Sports and academics took precedence until my high school years, paving the way for college. Delving deep within, I knew I had to align my career with my childhood passion. Determined, despite the lack of guidance around me, I embarked on a quest to find a job that would fulfill my yearning for wildlife exploration.

Receiving an athletic and academic scholarship, I enrolled in Park University's biology program in Parkville, MO. Choosing this institution was driven not only by scholarships but also by the opportunity to take Zoology in my freshman year—a subject I had long desired to explore. It was in this very class that my professor played a pivotal role in shaping my journey. Sharing my ambition, they provided valuable insights, helping me find clarity amidst uncertainty.

A couple of years later, that same professor extended an invitation to assist with a summer research study on turtles—an exhilarating opportunity I eagerly accepted. This marked my first taste of genuine research experience, where I gained valuable knowledge over the course of the summer. During the subsequent school year, I even presented my research multiple times for classes and a symposium at Park University.

A dear friend introduced me to the Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program, a National Science Foundation initiative that grants STEM undergraduates invaluable research exposure. Inspired by their experience, I explored REU programs and submitted several applications for the following summer. Fortunately, I was accepted into the University of Toledo's REU program, where I delved deeper into research, solidifying my passion. The REU program proved to be a transformative decision, offering insights into various career paths and enlightening discussions with graduate students, ultimately leading me to decide on pursuing graduate school.

Thus, in the following fall semester, I embarked on a quest to find the perfect graduate program. Despite initial disappointments, I persevered, submitting applications weekly for graduate programs and potential summer positions as a field technician. Just as I was losing hope, a professor reached out for an interview, igniting a spark of excitement. After the interview, I felt optimistic, and my enthusiasm was rewarded when that very professor offered me a place in their research project for the upcoming fall semester. Eagerly accepting, I began the application process for the graduate program.

Months later, an email arrived, bearing the words, "Congratulations, you've been accepted into Penn State University's Masters of Ecology program." It was a moment of immense pride and disbelief—I had accomplished what once seemed nearly impossible. From years of feeling lost and battling self-doubt, I had overcome the odds.

Now, on the verge of embarking on my graduate school journey, I eagerly anticipate diving deeper into the captivating realm of ecology and conducting further research.
