### About Me
#### My Story
Coming from Kansas City, KS, I have embraced the urban lifestyle throughout my upbringing. However, my childhood was a bit different from most kids. Toys and imagination didn't captivate me; instead, I found solace in exploration. Days were spent observing the intriguing world of insects in my yard, marveling at their interactions and movements. Watching birds frolic in the birdbath and squirrels darting through the yard became my enchanting pastime, mesmerizing me for hours.

As I grew older, societal norms steered me away from these exploratory endeavors. Sports and academics took precedence until my high school years, paving the way for college. Delving deep within, I knew I had to align my career with my childhood passion. Determined, despite the lack of guidance around me, I embarked on a quest to find a job that would fulfill my yearning for wildlife exploration.

Receiving an athletic and academic scholarship, I enrolled in Park University's biology program in Parkville, MO. Choosing this institution was driven not only by scholarships but also by the opportunity to take Zoology in my freshman year—a subject I had long desired to explore. It was in this very class that my professor played a pivotal role in shaping my journey. Sharing my ambition, they provided valuable insights, helping me find clarity amidst uncertainty.

A couple of years later, that same professor extended an invitation to assist with a summer research study on turtles—an exhilarating opportunity I eagerly accepted. This marked my first taste of genuine research experience, where I gained valuable knowledge over the course of the summer. During the subsequent school year, I even presented my research multiple times for classes and a symposium at Park University.

A dear friend introduced me to the Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program, a National Science Foundation initiative that grants STEM undergraduates invaluable research exposure. Inspired by their experience, I explored REU programs and submitted several applications for the following summer. Fortunately, I was accepted into the University of Toledo's REU program, where I delved deeper into research, solidifying my passion. The REU program proved to be a transformative decision, offering insights into various career paths and enlightening discussions with graduate students, ultimately leading me to decide on pursuing graduate school.

Thus, in the following fall semester, I embarked on a quest to find the perfect graduate program. Despite initial disappointments, I persevered, submitting applications weekly for graduate programs and potential summer positions as a field technician. Just as I was losing hope, a professor reached out for an interview, igniting a spark of excitement. After the interview, I felt optimistic, and my enthusiasm was rewarded when that very professor offered me a place in their research project for the upcoming fall semester. Eagerly accepting, I began the application process for the graduate program.

Months later, an email arrived, bearing the words, "Congratulations, you've been accepted into Penn State University's Masters of Ecology program." It was a moment of immense pride and disbelief—I had accomplished what once seemed nearly impossible. From years of feeling lost and battling self-doubt, I had overcome the odds.

While embarking on my graduate school journey, I eagerly anticipate diving deeper into the captivating realm of ecology and conducting further research.

### Research Project(s)
#### The Dwarf Reptile Project
In my current role as an M.S. graduate student, I am immersed in a compelling investigation focused on the life history evolution of five reptile species inhabiting the Channel Islands of California. My research delves into discerning variations in crucial traits such as clutch size, egg size, and the proportion of gravid individuals between mainland and island populations. This exploration aims to unravel the intricacies of life-history consequences associated with island dwarfism.

As an integral member of the Shared Molecular mechanisms Across Life history traits (SMAL) project, I actively contribute to this collaborative effort, which seeks to understand shared molecular mechanisms influencing diverse life history traits. Within this initiative, I am particularly engaged in the examination of field ultrasounds as a tool for observing and analyzing reproductive variables in insular dwarf reptiles on the Channel Islands of California. This multifaceted research endeavor holds the potential to enhance our comprehension of evolutionary dynamics in island ecosystems and contributes valuable insights to the broader understanding of life history evolution in reptilian populations.

#### First description of the spatial ecology of the northern map turtle in Lake Erie using satellite telemetry
- This research was conducted as a part of a National Science Foundation funded REU program at the University of Toledo. I was supervised by Dr. Jeanine Refsnider

Our study focused on the northern map turtle, the most abundant species found in Lake Erie. This turtle's ability to thrive in both river and lake habitats makes it an ideal model for understanding how aquatic turtles respond to environmental changes, such as climate change and harmful algal blooms. By utilizing satellite telemetry, we aimed to provide the first-ever insights into the spatial ecology, movement patterns, and home range sizes of map turtles in Lake Erie. Three adult female map turtles were equipped with satellite transmitters on an Ottawa County, Ohio nesting beach in June 2022. These transmitters, utilizing the ARGOS satellite network, remotely obtained geographic coordinates of each turtle's location multiple times a day. By analyzing the data within a geographic information system, we measured the total straight-line distance traveled, home range size (minimum convex polygon), and core activity area (95% kernel) of each turtle using ArcMap 10. Over the course of x weeks, the three turtles covered distances ranging from 0.03 to 0.08 km, while their home range sizes varied from 7.85 to 61.17 square km. Although the turtles predominantly stayed within their core activity areas, they occasionally ventured away for a few days before returning. These excursions may indicate foraging trips, particularly as northern map turtles are known to consume zebra mussels. Our research not only provides a groundbreaking description of movement patterns and spatial ecology for northern map turtles in Lake Erie but also demonstrates the effective use of satellite telemetry in monitoring the precise movements of aquatic turtles in the Great Lakes. This newfound knowledge of their geographic range and spatial distribution can significantly contribute to conservation efforts aimed at protecting other vulnerable and declining turtle species.

#### Aquatic Turtle population Stream Research Study
- This research was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Jeff Kimmons of Park University, where we launched a capture and release project to examine the population of semi-aquatic turtles inhabiting Rush Creek, located in Parkville Missouri.

Under the joint research leadership of Dr. Jeffery Kimmons, classmate Hunter Springer, and myself, a comprehensive study was undertaken to investigate the aquatic turtle population residing in Rush Creek, a prominent waterway near downtown Parkville, MO. Our focus encompassed multiple species commonly observed in the area, including the Common Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina), Western Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta), Red-eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), and Eastern Spiny Softshell (Apalone spinifera). As these species possess the ability to traverse land, they have the potential to form a burgeoning community in this region. By employing a meticulous methodology involving turtle capture and data collection, our research aims to uncover significant insights into the population dynamics and the overall ecosystem of this habitat.
